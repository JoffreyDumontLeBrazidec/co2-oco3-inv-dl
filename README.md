This project introduces the application of deep learning CO2

This project presents the development and application of a deep learning-based method for inverting CO2 atmospheric plumes
from power plants using satellite imagery of the CO2 total column mixing ratios (XCO2).

Our scripts and modules are written in Python, using Tensorflow as the deep learning framework.

To employ these scripts and train CNN models, download the datasets of fields and plumes from [inv-zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12788520).
Note that the data generation scripts are not part of this repository, but can be provided upon request.

Weights of trained models can be obtained from [inv-zenodo-weights](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12788520).

After data collection/generation, 'main.py` is used to train the CNN with config constructed from hydra.

For any queries, do not hesitate to reach out.
